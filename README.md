I was trying to get some experience with GUI's so I decided to work on an email editor that I could send emails from.

Update 1: I rewrote the GUI using PyQt instead of TKinter after researching that TKinter is not the best GUI toolkit.

Update 2: I added a feature to save drafts to a text file on your desktop. 

Update 3: Previously, I had hardcoded my email login info into the code but that was not portable so I added a login page that it opens to. If your login does not authenticate, you will get an error message and it will ask to reinput info. Also I added a "Show password" checkbox that you can check or uncheck, but it wil hide or show your password.
